### üöÄ Key Features

## ‚úÖ User Authentication
- The application includes a secure and intuitive user authentication system:
- **Signup/Login Forms**: Users can register with email and password or log into an existing account.
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Once logged in, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is issued by the backend and stored on the client side (usually in local storage). This token is attached to API requests to verify user identity.
- **Protected Routes**: Certain pages (e.g., profile, cart, dashboard) are only accessible when a valid token is present. If not authenticated, users are redirected to the login page.

### üõí Product Browsing & Shopping
- Users can explore a rich catalog of products through:
- **Dynamic Product Listings**: The homepage or shop page fetches a list of products from the backend and displays them using clean, responsive product cards.
- **Filtering by Categories/Subcategories**: Sidebar or dropdown options allow users to narrow down the product view based on categories like Electronics, Fashion, etc.
- **Search Bar**: Users can type keywords (like "shoes" or "headphones") to quickly find matching products.
- **Product Details Page**: Clicking on a product navigates to a dedicated page with full details, including title, description, images, price, availability, and more.

### üõçÔ∏è Shopping Cart
- This feature enables a real-time cart experience:
- **Add/Remove Products**: Each product card or detail page allows users to add items to their cart.
- **Quantity Management**: Users can increase or decrease quantities of individual items directly within the cart view.
- **Live Total Calculation**: The cart dynamically calculates and displays the total amount and total number of items.
- **Cart Persistence**: Cart data remains even after page refreshes (stored in local state or local storage depending on implementation).
---

### üë§ User Dashboard
- After logging in, users gain access to a personalized dashboard:
- **Profile Section**: View and update user information like name, email, or password.
- **Order History**: Displays a list of previous orders made by the user with details such as items, date, and status.
- **Wishlist and Address Book (Optional/Extendable)**: These are additional features that can be added to enhance the user experience.
